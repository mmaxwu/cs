</ul><p>We found N@TM to be an overall incredibly fun experience because we got to socialize with other people. We also loved discussing our creations with our classmates. Minesweeper and chess games from other groups were our favorites since they were so beautifully crafted and engaging for users to play. Because the parents of our peers had so many inquiries about our project, we really loved chatting to them. How we were able to gather the various recipes on our website seemed to be the most often asked question, in our opinion. Additionally, speaking with the CSA youth in the adjacent room was enjoyable since it allowed us to learn how the CSA manages its websites.</p>
