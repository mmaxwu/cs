    "A bit is a unit of information that can have two values, typically represented as a 0 or a 1. A byte is a unit of digital information that typically consists of eight bits. Hexadecimal, or \"hex\" for short, is a numbering system that uses 16 different digits, represented as the numbers 0 through 9 and the letters A through F. Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits, also known as a nibble. In other words, two hexadecimal digits can be used to represent one byte. Hexadecimal numbers are often used to represent large binary values in a more compact and human-readable form."
