    "Hi my name is Max. This is my page to document my journey through CSP. My computer science journey truly started in 8th grade. There were many electives to choose going into the 8th grade, I ended up choosing computer science because that was the class that all of my friends were planning on taking. Having no previous experience in computer science, I naturally struggled throughout the year. But with pain often comes joy. I remember creating my first website using html, spending hours trying to improve every little detail to make my website more appealing. Submitting the website was one of the happiest moments of my life. That feeling of accomplishment is what motivated me to enroll in this class. Having never touched a line of code in three years, it is not surprising to say that I am really rusty.  "
