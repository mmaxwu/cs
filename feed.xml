We also loved discussing our creations with our classmates. Minesweeper and chess games from other groups were our favorites since they were so beautifully crafted and engaging for users to play. Because the parents of our peers had so many inquiries about our project, we really loved chatting to them. How we were able to gather the various recipes on our website seemed to be the most often asked question, in our opinion. Additionally, speaking with the CSA youth in the adjacent room was enjoyable since it allowed us to learn how the CSA manages its websites.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Correcting Errors</title><link href="https://mmaxwu.github.io/cs/2022/10/11/FixingErrors.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Correcting Errors" /><published>2022-10-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://mmaxwu.github.io/cs/2022/10/11/FixingErrors</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Personal API</title><link href="https://mmaxwu.github.io/cs/api/weather" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Personal API" /><published>2022-10-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://mmaxwu.github.io/cs/api/weather</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Week 5" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Example API</title><link href="https://mmaxwu.github.io/cs/api/COVID19" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Example API" /><published>2022-10-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://mmaxwu.github.io/cs/api/PBL-python_rapidapi-copy</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Week 5" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Group Planning for Project + Agile Methodology</title><link href="https://mmaxwu.github.io/cs/week%205/markdown/2022/09/29/GroupProject.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Group Planning for Project + Agile Methodology" /><published>2022-09-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://mmaxwu.github.io/cs/week%205/markdown/2022/09/29/GroupProject</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Week 5" /><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roles Our team was split up like this: 1) Scrum Master: Max – organize scrum board and make sures framework is followed and is facilitating the scrum 2) Backend Developer: Nathan – build and maintain the technology that that powers all the work behind the scenes 3) Devops: Alyssa – starts with tools/processes needed for coding and deployment to maintenance and updates. 4) Frontend Developer: Sri – builds front end portion of the app (works the interactive and visual part of the design) “Agile Methodology Diagram” that our group created Drafting a Plan for the Final Project (Group Ideas) One idea for the project would be a an app that consists of multiple games (maybe 3 to 4, something similiar to game pigeon). The games would take user input and it would also need algorithms to shoot basketballs, arrows, etc. This app would teach our team many different skills in programming. In addition, it will take our interest for 8 weeks due to the vast tasks that need to be completed. Our Team Roles: Frontend Developer: create the visual images of games on the screen Backend Developer: create algortihims behind the scenes Dev Ops: make sure website functions correctly Scrum Master: faciliate the team and assign each member differnet goals, while also helping the frontend and backend developers Because apps like game pigeon already exist, this project may or may not be able to used outside of class. Finally, the project is good for the Create Performance Task because it incorporates all the different College Board requirments]]></summary></entry></feed>
