<h3 id="duck-dns">
<a class="anchor" href="#duck-dns" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Duck DNS</h3>
<p>The purpose of DuckDNS is to provide a free dynamic DNS service that allows users to map a hostname to a dynamic IP address. It is a good alternative to services like Freenom, which can have limitations and restrictions on their free offerings. While DNS is a critical infrastructure for the internet, dynamic DNS services like DuckDNS are useful for users who need to access their devices or services remotely but have a dynamic IP address that changes frequently. They allow users to access their resources using a hostname that remains constant even if the IP address changes, which is why I prefer DuckDNS over DNS</p>

<h3 id="certbot-hacks">
<a class="anchor" href="#certbot-hacks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Certbot HACKS</h3>
<p>OpenSSL and LibreSSL are two popular open-source cryptographic libraries used to implement the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. While both libraries are designed to provide secure and efficient encryption, there are some differences in their security features.</p>

<p>OpenSSL is known for its broad support of different cryptographic algorithms and protocols, including SSL/TLS, public key cryptography, and message digest algorithms. However, it has been criticized for its complex codebase and the occurrence of several high-profile vulnerabilities in recent years, such as the Heartbleed and CCS injection vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>In contrast, LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL that was created with the goal of simplifying and cleaning up OpenSSLâ€™s codebase to improve security and eliminate potential vulnerabilities. It includes several security enhancements, such as support for more secure cryptographic algorithms, a simpler and more secure memory allocator, and a proactive security audit process. LibreSSL is also designed to be more portable and compatible with a wider range of platforms than OpenSSL.</p>

<p>Despite these security improvements, both OpenSSL and LibreSSL have still been subject to vulnerabilities in recent years. For example, in 2021, OpenSSL disclosed a high-severity vulnerability that could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on a victimâ€™s machine. Similarly, in 2020, LibreSSL disclosed a vulnerability that could allow attackers to remotely crash the library.</p>

<p>In conclusion, both OpenSSL and LibreSSL are powerful and widely-used cryptographic libraries that provide secure encryption and authentication. However, while LibreSSL includes several security enhancements and aims to be more secure than OpenSSL, both libraries have been subject to vulnerabilities in recent years and require constant updates and maintenance to ensure their continued security.</p>
