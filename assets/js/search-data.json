            "content": "Video . My video demonstrating my feature can be found here video . Writeup . 2c. . This is a JavaScript program that implements the game of checkers. It includes functions to move the pieces, check for available moves, check for available attack moves, and eliminate pieces. The code defines the checkerboard and the pieces as objects, with properties such as the color of the pieces, the position of the pieces on the board, and whether the pieces are kings. . The makeMove() function takes an index as input and tries to make a move to that index. It checks whether a piece is selected and whether the index is a valid move. If it is a valid move, it executes the move and checks whether the piece has another attack move available. If there is another attack move, it shows the move. If there is no other move available, it changes turns and checks whether the game is over. . The executeMove() function takes a piece and moves it to a new position on the board. It updates the properties of the piece and the board. . The checkMove() function takes a piece and checks whether it can move in a certain direction. If it can move in that direction, it shows the move. . The checkAttack() function takes a piece and checks whether it can attack an opponent’s piece in a certain direction. If it can attack, it shows the move. . The eliminateCheck() function removes an opponent’s piece that has been attacked. . 3a. . 3.a.i. . This program helps the user de-stress, have fun, and cure boredom by providing small and fun game with user game history tracking. . 3.a.ii. . This program allows users to play a game of checkers by themselves, or with a friend. Checkers is a competitive yet fun game, so it will allow the players to relax. There is an outline showed by a grayed out box which shows where the user can go with the piece selected, which provides inexeperienced or new checkers players some guidance of how to play the game. . 3b. . 3.b.i. . . 3.b.ii. . . 3.b.iii. . The name of the variable representing the collection type is “data”, and new data for username, date(dogame), and result are added to the table . 3.b.iv. . The data that my list contains is important to my checkers game program because it contains every attribute about the data of the usernames and game, which are classified by username of red, username of black, result of red, result of black, and the date that this game was played. This is absolutely vital to the program as it is able to fetch and store the recieved data in order to populate the tables of the game history. . 3.b.v. . If the variable “data” is not utilized, the program will suffer from inefficiency, as it will necessitate individual variables for each attribute, resulting in code that is needlessly lengthy, bulky, and complicated. . 3c. . The list being used to manage complexity in the program is the “data” array in the “read_users” function. This array contains the game history data fetched from the API and is iterated over using a for loop to dynamically create rows in the HTML table for each game. The sorting of the data by date in the same function also helps to manage the complexity of displaying the game history in an organized manner. . 4c. . 4c.i. . The selected procedure is read_users() which fetches data from an API and displays it in an HTML table. Here are two calls to this procedure: Call 1 - This call will fetch data from the API and display it in the HTML table specified by the resultContainer variable. The function will use default options for the fetch request and will sort the data by date and time before displaying it in the table. . Call 2 - This call specifies the url and read_fetch variables to be used in the fetch request. It then passes read_fetch as an argument to the read_users() function. This call will fetch data from the API at the specified URL and display it in the HTML table specified by the resultContainer variable. The function will use default options for the fetch request and will sort the data by date and time before displaying it in the table. . 4c.ii. . The add_row() function is called within the read_users() function inside a for loop that iterates over the JSON data returned from the API. The purpose of the function is to add a row to the HTML table for each game returned in the API response. . The add_row() function receives an object called data as its input, which contains the following properties: uidB, resultB, uidR, resultR, and dogame. These properties correspond to the Black Username, Black Result, Red Username, Red Result, and Date &amp; Time columns in the HTML table, respectively. . The first call to add_row() occurs inside the then block of the fetch() call in read_users(). This call is made if the response status is 200 (i.e., successful), and the returned JSON data is sorted by date in descending order. Therefore, this call adds a row to the HTML table for each game in the API response, with the games displayed in descending order by date. . The second call to add_row() occurs inside the catch block of the fetch() call in read_users(). This call is made if there is an error in the fetch() call, such as when access to the server is blocked. In this case, the function adds an error message to the HTML table, which is displayed in a new row. . 4c. iii. . The code is fetching data from a backend API using a GET request to the URL https://pythonalflask.tk/api/checkers/checkersList, then sorting the data by date and time (dogame property) in descending order. . The data is then displayed in an HTML table with the id attribute “recentGames” and the tbody element with the id attribute “checkersList”. The table has five columns: “Black Username”, “Black Result”, “Red Username”, “Red Result”, and “Date &amp; Time”. . For each row of data, a new HTML tr element is created with five td elements to display the data in the appropriate columns of the table. The add_row function is called to add each row of data to the HTML table. . Finally, if there is an error fetching or processing the data, an error message is displayed in a single row of the table with the appropriate error message. .",

            "content": "Project 1 . This project from the CSA class was beautifully designed. The color scheme and font matches together really well, and it gave me a very pleasant experience navigating through their website. From this project I learned how important the UI of a website is, and how I can take advantage of this to make my own website more enjoyable. . Project 2 . This project really surprised me because they used Google Maps as the core part of their project. Me and my group actually brainstormed about a website based off an interactive map, but we scrapped the idea because we thought it would be too hard to successfully execute. Looking at this project, the “Near Me Finder” is perfectly executed by using an already mature resource that is Google Maps . Project 3 . This is another part of the previous group’s project. I feel like this project is very unique and very well put together. As the website is titled “Rental Retreats”, I believed the features of a schedule maker, reviews page, near me finder, and pick your homes ties to the central theme extremely well. . Project 4 . This person’s N@M project perfectly embodies how me and many students feel about the various AP course offerings of Del Norte High. This perfectly embodied how I felt when I took the AP Physics C Mechanics work and energy unit test. . Project 5 . On the surface, this is just two men shaking hands, but this image actually has significant political importance. The young man on the left, is of Pakistani origin, and the young man on the right, is of Indian origin. In this day of age, India and Pakistan has not had the brightest of political relations. However, in this picture, what’s supposed to be enemies, are actually shaking hands. Government doesn’t define how people feel, and this is the perfect embodiment. . Reflection . This tri’s N@M projects were a lot better than last tri’s because everyone seemed to be polishing their skills as the year goes on. All of the projects that I have looked at inspired me for my own project, so I believe this N@M was definitely not a waste of time, but rather a very fruitful experience. .",

Instead of having to spend hours going from car dealer to car dealer asking questions about a car, the user can find all the information they need in one place on one website. | Since our project has a sign up and log in feature, this means that users can “save” cars their account and refer beck to them by logging in to the website again. This feature makes looking for information easy and fast. | . | Think of a potential harmful effect of your project. I think that our website could potentially be a disruptor in how people look for a car to buy. Instead of seeing the car in person, the user might base their purchase only on what they see online but when they actually get the car, it isn’t what they were anticipating. This can create some false expectations which wouldn’t be good for someone trying to make an important purchase. | . | What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. Its obviously very upsetting that digital divide is something that exists. I think its very unfair that not everyone has access to the same opportunities and education, something that is partially effected by the digital divide. Those who do not have computers lose access to the internet and all the information that comes with it. As a result, they fall behind other, not because they lack the skill, but because they lack the resources which is extremely unfair. | . | Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? | Pros Cons . prevents students from getting distracted (ex: games, youtube, instagram etc.). | . | could block websites and videos that are actually informational and needed during classroom work-time | This creates a bias against what should and should not be filtered. Some content that is actually purposeful and informational might get blocked just because of it&#39;s source which is considered &quot;bad&quot; | students don&#39;t have access to good internet which can impair the quality of learning | . | . 5.3 Computer Bias . Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . The age group that uses Facebook are people ages 25-34 | The age group uses tik tok are people ages 10-19 | there are purposeful exclusions on platforms like tik tok. For example, people who are 13 and under can’t sign up and tik tok does this to prevent young children from viewing possibly inappropriate content so it’s beneficial in that sense so it shouldn’t be corrected. It’s bad business for a company like Facebook which is primarily a platform for older people. Facebook thus loses younger users. | . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . using only female voices might imply to some that females fill the role of “submissiveness” as they serve the owner of the virtuous devices. It might also promote the bias that women are assistants. | this should be corrected and virtual assistants should include more male voices to make things more balanced | it’s good business because people might find female voices more pleasing and thus be more inclined to buy the device so in that sense, it’s very purposeful that these companies choose to set the voice to female by default. | . Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) . there are algorithms that different companies use to capture the users attention. For example, tik tok has a “for you page” which shows videos that appeal to the users interests and these interests are filled out beforehand by the user. In addition this algorithm pushes trends to the user which can have harmful effects such as in the case of the “devious lick” trend. In addition companies like Facebook and Amazon have ads on the side of your screen based on your search history. | . Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? If yes or no, justify you conclusion. . I don’t think the owner thinks its intentional because he’s carrying a light joking tone throughout the video showing how he’s more so making fun of the machine vs being angry at it. | . How do you think this happened? . the lightning might have been bad or during development, the developers may have only tested the technology with white testers thus failed to recognize the errors when a black man tested the tech | . Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? . this is harmful because it’s unintentionally exclusive | . Should it be corrected? What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? . this should be corrected and developers definitely need to solve the tech to make it inclusive of people with all skin colors. I think the company needs to do more testing. | . Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write. . Every product that is developed will have some type of bias. The best way to combat this bias is to get feedback and opinions from a diverse group of people. That way, any software can have an inclusive usage and be good for everyone | . 5.4 Crowd Sourcing . We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used. . I have used an API with symptoms including cough, fever, etc. I used this in my tri1 project. Our crossover team used a Wikipedia API. | . We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub? . the biggest discovery I’ve found on GitHub is GitHub.dev. It allows you to look at peoples code and it’s format through the web. | . Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting? . there is a lot of medical apis, car apis, covid data, election results, and even arrests in the city of Chicago. | . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsourcing idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . I think slack is in a sense apcsps form of crowd sourcing. Important information is sent there and people can ask questions and get answers on the slack as well | . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . Del Norte definitely needs better crowd sourcing. Currently, a lot of decisions made by the school are done by the staff or ASB, however regular students don’t really have a chance to say much. I think making a board of students could help with this problem. These students could get feedback from classes and then give that input to those who make final decisions. | my own project could be better with crowd sourcing because it would gain more advice and perspectives thus allowing it to grow | . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . I could make a google form, but to make it more csp related, I could set up a SQLite database to collect feedback from every student who stops to see the project. This feedback would all be collected in one place. | . 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns . When you create a GitHub repository, it asks you to choose a license type. For this Tech Talk, you need to review the license options and make notes in your personal blog. The licenses include: . Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal: This license dedicates the work to the public domain, waiving any copyright interest. Open Source GPL License: This license lets people do almost anything they want with the project, except distributing closed source versions. Open Source MIT License: This license allows for free use of the code and making and distributing closed source versions, but the author usually wants credit for the work. In your blog, you should summarize the discussions and your personal thoughts about software licenses, digital rights, and legal and ethical considerations from the College Board topic. You should explain that open source licenses require code to be public, while closed source licenses allow the code to be private. Some open source licenses prevent closed source distribution. Digital rights are the terms of service that protect, play, and distribute content, but there are ways to bypass these digital rights, which can have negative impacts on the content creators. . You should create a license for your personal blog and the team repositories for the CPT project, making sure to have a license for both the frontend and backend repositories. You should document the license(s) you chose and the reason behind the choice. The frontend, built on GitHub pages, may come with its own license and restrictions, so you should document the team’s process of making the license choice and updating it in your blog. . You added a GNU General Public License v.3.0 license file called LICENSE.md to your Fast Pages Blog and did the same for the backend and frontend servers. . In your CompSci Principles project, you have seen Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the form of email and password for the user login and sign-up system. You feel that some PII will be publicly available, but sensitive information like passwords and personal credentials should be kept private. You have PII available on platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn. . A bad password is one that lacks authentication, such as Symmetric encryption where only one key is used for encryption and decryption. A good password has a system of authentication, like Multi-factor authentication where a code is required or Asymmetric cryptography where a pair of related keys are used for encryption and decryption. . You explained Symmetric encryption as a type of encryption where only one key is used for both encryption and decryption and Asymmetric cryptography as a process using a pair of related keys to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access. You used asymmetric cryptography for the security of your Fast Pages site. . You have experienced a phishing scheme where you received a message from someone claiming to offer free Nitro, but in reality, it was a trap to get your personal information and hack your Discord or Instagram account. You should describe this as an example of phishing and mention other phishing techniques like fraudulent emails or websites. . 5.6 Safe Computing . Can you explain the PII you encountered during your project in Computer Science Principles? . In our project, we developed a username input, which can be considered as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). What are your thoughts on PII and your own experience with it? . I believe that some PII is bound to be public, but it’s crucial to keep sensitive information like passwords and personal credentials private. As for my own experience, I have PII available on the internet, particularly on my Instagram and LinkedIn profiles where I have my name and achievements listed. Can you describe good and bad passwords and another method used for authentication? . A bad password is one that lacks proper authentication methods. For instance, symmetric encryption is not an appropriate system for passwords as it uses only one key (a secret key) to encrypt and decrypt information. A good password should have a strong authentication system. For instance, multi-factor authentication that requires users to enter a code sent via text or email. Another method for ensuring good password security is asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, which uses a pair of related keys - one public and one private - to encrypt and decrypt messages and protect against unauthorized access. Can you explain Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption? . Symmetric encryption uses a single secret key to encrypt and decrypt electronic information, which makes it unsuitable for password security. Asymmetric cryptography, on the other hand, uses a pair of related keys, one public and one private, to encrypt and decrypt messages and protect against unauthorized access. We implemented this method on our fastpages site for enhanced security. Can you give an example of the encryption we used in our AWS deployment? Can you describe a phishing scheme you’ve encountered and other phishing tactics you know of? . I’ve been a victim of a phishing scheme when I received a message on Discord from someone claiming to be a friend with a link to “free nitro”. However, the link redirected me to a page where I was asked to provide personal information, which was then used to hack my Discord account. I’ve also had similar experiences on Discord and Instagram. .",

The end goal of the collegeboard create performance tasks is to challenge students to write a program and expertly explain a wide range aspects convered by the program in complexity management, purpose and functionality, and algorithm implementation. Due to this, we have begun a team project in hopes of practicing such skills. I personally work on one small program of our entire project, but within this sub program still contains all of the required collegeboard aspects. . Video: . I will first play a round of snake, then go through all our features. The first feature is the leaderboard, and I will show the score saving into the leaderboard, and replacing a score on there. Then I will play the snake game again, getting a better score this time, I will show the leaderboard updating to my new score, and also showing the history log for that user. . My Portion: . My portion of the project is logging the history of the 5 most recent scores of every user. My part of the program will be connected with the DB because the history will be persistent data. . Row 1 - Purpose and Function . In my write-up, I will first review the program’s purpose, function and inputs, which is to provide the users with a fun and interactive experience that they can revisit and compete with others . Row 2 - Data Abstraction . The first code section displays the “json_ready” list in the “ScoreListAPI” class in the “score.py” file located in the “api” folder. The second code section, located directly below the list, displays all code below the line “return jsonify(json_ready)”. This list holds all the data for the entered scores and profile information. . Row 3 - Managing Complexity . Manages complexity by generating all the history into a table . Row 4 - Procedural Abstraction . Create a database table to store the user’s information, including their username, score, and date of the score. . | Write a function that allows a user to submit their score. This function should take in the user’s username and score as input, and store this information in the database table. . | Write a function that retrieves a user’s score history, which should retrieve all of the scores for a given username from the database table. . | Row 5 - Algorithm Implementation . I will add the code segment “def initScores()” in the model folder of scores.py. This function sets up a test database and tables, adds users with specified parameters to a list, and uses a for loop to input the data into the table. It also includes try and except statements. . Row 6 - Testing . Calls: Input the data into the table Conditions: create() function used for creating new data Result: Logs all the username scores into the table . We haven&#39;t automated database yet, so the data will be manually inputted by us for testing reasons .",

            "content": "Big Idea 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects . Benefits: The ability of computing to perform numerous simple calculations in a split second is a significant advantage. The calculative nature of computers enables us to decompose complicated processes into easy-to-understand, standalone instructions. These answers are then combined to produce an answer to a more complex issue. Additionally, the instantaneity provided by the internet enables the typical individual to do a search and rapidly get answers to a specific query. Finally, computers provides us with incredibly quick ways to communicate via video calling and online SMS spaces. In the end, these advantages help to connect the world’s infrastructure and speed up collaboration. . Harms: The use of technology, particularly in the digital realm, poses significant moral and ethical dilemmas. For example, the internet is largely powered by vast amounts of data that provide users with the information they seek. All functioning programs and services store user data or input that can be saved online indefinitely. Posting personal or undesirable content online can make it challenging or nearly impossible to remove. Additionally, privacy concerns extend to the unauthorized collection of data, such as the use of private searches and online history to personalize recommendations on social media, which can result in the sale of personal information. Finally, technology has a significant impact on the environment, including pollution from the production of chips, which require vast amounts of minerals and metals. . Big Idea 5.2 Digital Divide . How does someone empower themself in a digital world?: . By sharing their accomplishments and inventions online, someone may empower oneself in the digital world. This is often a nice method to demonstrate one’s abilities to others, but it may also be destructive because there is a small but vocal minority online who will try to degrade others for their own enjoyment. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.?: . People who are empowered often assist people who are not empowered by giving them some kind of physical or mental assistance. For instance, by sharing the information we acquire in class and on our own time, my friends and I are able to empower one another in our demanding academic life. Through this, we would still have a safety net that might aid us at our lowest and assure a positive academic end or result, even if we struggle in school and might feel disheartened. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?: . Requiring paper forms or bureaucratic procedures hinders rather than empowers individuals. Forcing students to use a specific medium can create additional challenges if they don’t have the necessary materials, leading to missed deadlines. Similarly, a rigid process decreases efficiency in both educational and workplace settings by disregarding alternative, more effective and efficient methods for completing tasks. .",

            "content": "Test Corrections . This question goes under the topic of boolean expressions, which I need to review and do more problems. This is one of the three questions on this test about logic gates, which are questions I have never encountered before. After checking out the collegeboard videos provided on the section, I did not have any takeaways as collegeboard did not cover logic gate type questions. But anyways, using my deductive skills, I have figured out this question. The question tells us that the output has to be true, so by working our way from bottom to top, true has to be with true in the and statement in order to be true, and working up to the first logic gate, false has to be with true in the or statement in order to be true. . This question goes under the topic of iteration. The problem with this code is that i will never end up being 4, so this makes the code keep on looping while displaying nothing. . This question goes under the topic of iteration again, but it is one of those numerous robot problems that were on the test. In this problem, the main issue I had to deal with was choosing between C and D. The problem I had with those two choices are that they are iterations within iterations, which is confusing for me. In the end, I gave up and chose D, because I thought C was definitely wrong. Previously, I thought “REPEAT 2 TIMES” meant that after the first iteration, it will iterate two MORE times, which would end up being three iterations, resulting in the wrong place for the robot. But it turns out the outer iteration determines how many TOTAL iterations will take place, which is why C is the correct answer. . This question goes under the topics of iteration and calling procedure, but that doesn’t matter since I got this question wrong because of my carelessness. I didn’t notice that the answer choice A which I selected and got wrong set the initial value of radius to 0. The problem with this is that the first statement of the code is to draw the circle, and the first circle in the question clearly has a radius, so A is wrong. . This question goes under the topic of random values. I got this question wrong due to my carelessness again. Answer choice C which was what I chose and got wrong is wrong because it is only evaluating the number 2 among 10 numbers, which is a 10 percent chance. What the question asked for was 20 percent, so answer choice D is correct because numbers 1 and 2 takes up 20 percent of numbers 1 through 10. . Summary . Topics that I need to work on are: Boolean expressions in the form of logic gates, iterations, and most importantly, not making clumsy mistakes. If I had been more keen to the answer choices, I could have avoided 2 out of the 5 mistakes I had this test. .",

However, I did award a point, believing that the stated purpose was sufficient. This means that when I submit my project to Collegeboard, I should provide a more detailed and specific purpose for the program, while still keeping it concise. For Submission 2, I did not award a point for Data Abstraction because I thought that a screenshot of the list variable was required in the code segment. However, Collegeboard did award the point for Data Abstraction because the code segments demonstrated the use of lists. While the list was not explicitly mentioned in the code segment, it was still evident that it was being utilized. The names of the lists were also specified in 3.b.iii, so the grader knew which variables were lists in the code. This tells me that it is important to demonstrate the use of lists in the code segments rather than just showing their creation. Through grading these submissions, I have learned that I do not need to write a whole paragraph for each subsection of 3a. I have also learned that it is important to be more detailed and explain the code when creating my project. . Summary . To summarize, my CPT scores have taught me that it is not always necessary to be overly detailed in my responses, but that some areas, such as explaining algorithms and procedures, do require more detail. Additionally, I have learned that lists and procedures can be used in creative ways, and that testing should focus on specific code rather than just the user experience. Furthermore, I have found that it is important to provide specific values for arguments and to ensure that conditions are relevant to the parameters. . Submission 1: .

It provides tools for reading and writing data to various formats, as well as tools for manipulating and analyzing data. For example, Pandas includes functions for filtering and sorting data, as well as tools for performing operations like groupby and pivot tables. This makes Pandas a useful tool for working with large datasets, especially those that are tabular or structured in some way. . Matplotlib is a library for creating visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of plotting functions and tools, including functions for creating scatter plots, line plots, histograms, and more. Matplotlib also includes support for customization and formatting of plots, allowing programmers to create high-quality visualizations that are tailored to their specific needs. This makes Matplotlib a valuable tool for exploring and understanding data, as well as for presenting results and findings to others. . Together, these two libraries provide a powerful set of tools for working with data in Python. Pandas makes it easy to import, manipulate, and analyze data, while Matplotlib provides a variety of tools for creating visualizations that can help to better understand and communicate the insights that can be gleaned from the data. These libraries are commonly used in a wide range of fields, including data science, scientific computing, and machine learning, and can save programmers a significant amount of time and effort when working with data in Python. .

So, what is a simulation anyway? . A simulation is a tested scenario used for viewing results/outputs to prepare for them in real world situations . | These can be used for games like dice rolling, spinners, etc . | These can be used for practical things such as building structures, testing car crashes, and other things before engaging in them in the real world . | These simulations can have the option of obeying real world physics (Gravity, collision) or they can go against these norms since this is a fictitious scenario, and couldn&#39;t happen in real life . | .

Binary Search Hacks . def binary_search(arr, x): # Initialize the start and end indices of the array start = 0 end = len(arr) - 1 # Iterate until the start and end indices overlap while start &lt;= end: # Calculate the middle index of the array mid = (start + end) // 2 # Compare x with the middle element if arr[mid] == x: # Return the middle index if x matches the middle element return mid elif x &gt; arr[mid]: # Update the start index to search the right half of the array start = mid + 1 else: # Update the end index to search the left half of the array end = mid - 1 # If x is not found in the array, return -1 return -1 arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] x = 11 result = binary_search(arr, x) if result != -1: print(&quot;Found at position: &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not in the array!&quot;) . Found at position: 10 . In the code above, the binary_search() function takes two arguments: arr, the array to search, and x, the target element we are looking for. The function returns the index of x in the array if it is found, or -1 if it is not found. The code also includes a test that searches for the value 11 in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The test prints the index of 11 if it is found, or a message if it is not found. .

In the code above, the while loop continues until n becomes 1. The if statement checks if n is even or odd, and performs the appropriate calculation to update n according to the Collatz conjecture. The steps counter is incremented after each calculation. When the loop ends, the final value of steps is printed, which represents the number of steps required to reach 1. . For the input n = 5, the code would output 6, because it takes 6 steps to reach 1 using the Collatz conjecture starting from n = 5. .",

A variable is a named location in a computer&#39;s memory where a value can be stored and retrieved. In most programming languages, variables have a specific data type, which determines the kind of values that the variable can store. . | Data types are categories that are used to classify the different types of data that can be stored in a variable. Examples of common data types include integers, which are whole numbers, and strings, which are sequences of characters. . | Assignment operators are operators that are used to assign a value to a variable. In most programming languages, the assignment operator is the equal sign (=). For example, the following code uses the assignment operator to assign the value 10 to a variable named x: . | . x = 10 . Once this code is executed, the value 10 will be stored in the variable x, and we can use the variable to access this value later in the program. For example, we could print the value of x using the following code: . print(x) # Output: 10 . It is important to note that the assignment operator is different from the equality operator (==), which is used to compare two values for equality. For example, the following code uses the equality operator to check whether the value of x is equal to 10: . if x == 10: print(&quot;x is equal to 10&quot;) . In this case, the code will print the message &quot;x is equal to 10&quot; because the value of x is indeed equal to 10. . Managing Complexity with Variables: Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class: Managing complexity with variables involves using different data structures to organize and manipulate data in a way that makes it easier to understand and work with. Some common data structures for managing complexity include lists, 2D lists, dictionaries, and classes. . A list is an ordered collection of values that can be of any data type. In most programming languages, lists are enclosed in square brackets ([]) and the values within a list are separated by commas. For example, the following code defines a list of three strings: . names = [&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;] . A 2D list, also known as a two-dimensional array or matrix, is a list of lists. It is a data structure that allows us to store and manipulate data in a grid-like format. For example, the following code defines a 2D list with three rows and four columns: . grid = [ [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12] ] . A dictionary is a data structure that maps keys to values. In most programming languages, dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces ({}) and the keys and values within a dictionary are separated by colons. For example, the following code defines a dictionary that maps strings to integers: . ages = { &quot;Alice&quot;: 25, &quot;Bob&quot;: 30, &quot;Charlie&quot;: 35 } . A class is a blueprint for creating objects. In object-oriented programming, a class defines the attributes and behaviors of a particular type of object. For example, the following code defines a class named Person with two attributes (name and age) and one behavior (a method named greet() that prints a greeting message): . A class is a blueprint for creating objects. In object-oriented programming, a class defines the attributes and behaviors of a particular type of object. For example, the following code defines a class named Person with two attributes (name and age) and one behavior (a method named greet() that prints a greeting message): . These data structures can be used to manage the complexity of data by organizing it in a way that makes it easier to understand and work with. For example, we could use a list to store a collection of strings, a 2D list to store a grid of numbers, a dictionary to store a mapping of keys to values, or a class to define the attributes and behaviors of a particular type of object. . Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration: . An algorithm is a set of steps or procedures for solving a specific problem. It is a step-by-step approach to achieving a desired result. . | A sequence is a series of steps or events that occur in a specific order. In programming, a sequence can refer to the order in which statements or blocks of code are executed. . | Selection is the process of choosing between different options or paths based on certain conditions. In programming, selection is often implemented using control structures such as if statements or switch statements, which allow the program to execute different code blocks depending on whether a certain condition is met. . | Iteration is the process of repeating a set of steps or instructions multiple times. In programming, iteration is often implemented using looping structures such as for loops or while loops, which allow the program to execute a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met. . | . # Define a function to find the largest number in a list def find_largest(numbers): # Set the initial largest number to the first number in the list largest = numbers[0] # Iterate through the rest of the numbers in the list for number in numbers[1:]: # If the current number is larger than the current largest number, update the largest number if number &gt; largest: largest = number # Return the largest number return largest # Test the function with a list of numbers numbers = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4] largest = find_largest(numbers) print(f&quot;The largest number is {largest}.&quot;) . The largest number is 5. . Expressions, Comparison Operators, Booleans Expressions and Selection, Booleans Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables: . An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that produces a result when evaluated. Expressions can be used to perform calculations or to return a value. . | Comparison operators are operators that compare two values and return a Boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false. Some common comparison operators in Python are: . | . ==: equal to !=: not equal to . :greater than&lt;: less than =:greater than or equal to&lt;=: less than or equal to . Boolean expressions are expressions that evaluate to a Boolean value of True or False. They can be created using comparison operators or by combining other Boolean expressions using logical operators such as and, or, and not. | . Selection refers to the process of choosing between different options or paths based on certain conditions. In programming, selection is often implemented using control structures such as if statements or switch statements, which allow the program to execute different code blocks depending on whether a certain condition is met. Boolean expressions can be used in selection to determine which code block to execute based on the truth value of the expression. . | Iteration is the process of repeating a set of steps or instructions multiple times. In programming, iteration is often implemented using looping structures such as for loops or while loops, which allow the program to execute a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met. Boolean expressions can be used in iteration to control the execution of the loop by determining when to terminate the loop based on the truth value of the expression. . | A truth table is a chart that lists all possible combinations of input values for a logical function and shows the corresponding output value for each combination. Truth tables can be used to help understand the behavior of logical expressions and to test the correctness of logical expressions. . | . # Define a function to check if a number is odd def is_odd(number): return number % 2 != 0 # Test the function with some numbers print(is_odd(1)) # True print(is_odd(2)) # False print(is_odd(3)) # True # Define a function to check if a number is within a certain range def in_range(number, lower, upper): return lower &lt;= number &lt;= upper # Test the function with some numbers print(in_range(5, 1, 10)) # True print(in_range(5, 6, 10)) # False print(in_range(5, 1, 5)) # True # Use a Boolean expression in an if statement x = 5 if x &gt; 0: print(&quot;x is positive.&quot;) # Use a Boolean expression in a while loop x = 5 while x &gt; 0: print(x) x -= 1 # Use a truth table to test a logical expression # # Inputs: A B # Output: A and B # # A | B | A and B # --++ # 0 | 0 | 0 # 0 | 1 | 0 # 1 | 0 | 0 # 1 | 1 | 1 .

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or functions, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedocode to python | . def convertFahrenheit(temperature): celsius = temperature - 32 celsius = celsius * 5/9 return celsius outsideTemp = input(&quot;What is the temperature outside?&quot;) outsideTemp = (convertFahrenheit(int(outsideTemp))) print(outsideTemp) . 15.555555555555555 . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . def gradeCalculation (score): print(&quot;What was the quiz grade?&quot;) quizGrade = input() quizGrade = int(quizGrade) currentGrade = score / 40 currentGrade = currentGrade * 100 if currentGrade &gt; quizGrade: quizGrade = currentGrade print(quizGrade) else: print(currentGrade) print(&quot;What was the overall grade&quot;) finalScore = input() finalScore = (gradeCalculation(int(finalScore))) print(finalScore) . What was the overall grade What was the quiz grade? 75.0 None . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is __ abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing __ in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called __ | A procedural abstraction may __ shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a __ procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the __ can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | . MOVE_FORWARD()|turnCorner()| ROTATE_RIGHT |MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD()|MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() MOVE_FORWARD MOVE_FORWARD() . Hacks . Write a python procedure about something which can help you in school, for example the teacher’s function we spoke about earlier. | Points will be awarded based on creativity and functionality | 0.1 points will be deducted for late submissions | Submit the notes with all blanks filled in (scored out of 0.5 points) and the python procedure (scored out of 0.5 points) by Monday 12/12 at 11:59 PM. | . def procedure() # code goes here return # code goes here .",

A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | . The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library! . Hacks: . Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code. . API&#8217;s .

Drafting a Plan for the Final Project (Group Ideas) . One idea for the project would be a an app that consists of multiple games (maybe 3 to 4, something similiar to game pigeon). The games would take user input and it would also need algorithms to shoot basketballs, arrows, etc. This app would teach our team many different skills in programming. In addition, it will take our interest for 8 weeks due to the vast tasks that need to be completed. Our Team Roles: . Frontend Developer: create the visual images of games on the screen | Backend Developer: create algortihims behind the scenes | Dev Ops: make sure website functions correctly | Scrum Master: faciliate the team and assign each member differnet goals, while also helping the frontend and backend developers Because apps like game pigeon already exist, this project may or may not be able to used outside of class.

            "content": "CS Before CSP . Hi my name is Max. This is my page to document my journey through CSP. My computer science journey truly started in 8th grade. There were many electives to choose going into the 8th grade, I ended up choosing computer science because that was the class that all of my friends were planning on taking. Having no previous experience in computer science, I naturally struggled throughout the year. But with pain often comes joy. I remember creating my first website using html, spending hours trying to improve every little detail to make my website more appealing. Submitting the website was one of the happiest moments of my life. That feeling of accomplishment is what motivated me to enroll in this class. Having never touched a line of code in three years, it is not surprising to say that I am really rusty. . Iterations . The first thing I learned in Mr. Mortensen&#39;s CSP class is iterations or loops. Iteration is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated. With iteration, I made a cool little quiz. . def q_and_a(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg questions = 6 correct = 0 print(&quot;Hello, you will be taking the vocabulary test.&quot;) print(&quot;Do you wish to proceed?(y/n)&quot;) msg = input() while (msg!=&quot;y&quot;) : print(&quot;ERROR, YOU HAVE TO SAY YES, DON&#39;T HAVE A CHOICE&quot;) msg = input() print(&quot;You may now proceed&quot;) rsp = q_and_a(&quot;Does static text change? (yes/no)&quot;) if rsp == &quot;no&quot;: print(rsp +&quot; is correct&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp +&quot; is wrong :(&quot;) rsp = q_and_a(&quot;At least how many lines are required to form a sequence of code?(1-4)&quot;) if rsp == &quot;2&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = q_and_a(&quot;Is Input and Output in jupyter notebooks in line with Output?(yes/no)&quot;) if rsp == &quot;no&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = q_and_a(&quot;Is the computer mice an input?(yes/no)&quot;) if rsp == &quot;yes&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = q_and_a(&quot;What is a number with a decimal in it called?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;float&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = q_and_a(&quot;What is a set of instructions that a computer follows in order to complete a task called?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;program&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) print(&quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions)) . Hello, you will be taking the vocabulary test. Do you wish to proceed?(y/n) You may now proceed Question: Does static text change? (yes/no) n is wrong :( Question: At least how many lines are required to form a sequence of code?(1-4) 2 is correct! Question: Is Input and Output in jupyter notebooks in line with Output?(yes/no) no is correct!! Question: Is the computer mice an input?(yes/no) yes is correct!! Question: What is a number with a decimal in it called? float is correct!! Question: What is a set of instructions that a computer follows in order to complete a task called? code is incorrect! you scored 4/6 . Sorting Algorithms .

The first question of the quiz makes you believe it is a normal quiz, until you click on the next slide… . Something Different: I utilized the playSound UI control. There will be a “correct” sound when the user gets the answer correct, and a “incorrect” sound when the user gets the answer incorrect. I also utilized the setTimeout control. When I made my first test quiz I found clicking on a “next question” button was annoying, so I found out I could use the setTimeout control to automatically switch to the next page after a set amount of time. . Creation 2: . . Link To Impossible Pong . I have always been fascinated by game developing since I was a kid, and just creating this simple game showed me how tough game developing is. The main challenge of making this game was creating the motion of the opposing paddle. I realized that if I made the pong slow enough, and if I made a uniform motion of the paddle, it is actually impossible for the user to defeat the opponent, so I named my game “Impossible Pong”. Another challenge I faced while creating this game was the fact that everything when out of the borders. After some research, I found the sprites toolbox, which helps all with simple game development. “topEdge” and “bottomEdge” helped me create a border so nothing goes outside of the screen. . Something that I will work on next week is making a pong game with a smart ai, and implementing different difficulties ranging from easy to hard. .",

Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it | A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function | A computing innovation can be physical (eg. self-driving car), nonphysical computing software (eg. picture editing software), or a nonphysical computing concept (eg. e-commerce) | Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in development | . How to collaborate in class? . Two programmers work together as a pair. One (the driver) writes program code, while the other (the observer, pointer, or navigator) reviews each line of program code as it is typed in | Don’t be a back-seated programmer! | Think-Pair-Share: Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class | Leave comments in code Communicate to your partner(s) | Communicate to yourself | Acknowledge code segments used from other sources | Acknowledge media used form other sources | Differentiate what you and your partner(s) did | Clarify the functionality of yoru code | . | Online tools: repl.it - multiplayer | Github - collaboration and repository | Share document or folder | Ask friends and family to test your program and give you feedback | Check with your teacher | . | . 1.2 . Computing Innovations . Applications Games | Social Media | Business | Productivity | . | Physical Devices Computers | Smart Phones/tablets | Smart “Things” | Wearables | . | Systems E-commerce | Cloud services | E-mail | . | . Inputs and Outputs . Input can come from a user or other programs Tactile (touch) | Audio | Visual | Text (including numerical values) | . | How do programs receive input? Most programs are written in an event driven environment Events are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program | . | . | What does input accomplish in a program? Input usually affects the output | . | What are outputs produced by a device? Visual | Audio | Tactile (touch/feel) | Text | . | How does a program know what to do upon an event? An action triggers an event Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device | . | . | The program code is not necessarily executed “in order” Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered | . | . What is a program . A program is a collection of statements A statement is a single command | A group of statements is called a code segment | Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language | . | . 1.3 . How is a program developed? . It starts with an idea Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan | Sometimes the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad) | . | Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect Investigation is an important step in the process | Developers must: Determine the requirements of the program | Understand the constraints | . | How do developers investigate? Surveys | User testing | Interviews | Direct observations | . | . | Design the program | Testing, testing, and more testing! | . How is a program developed . Program development is rarely a solo endeavor Programs are usually developed by teams of people | Individuals/teams work on different functional components | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work | Their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project | . | Can use comments within the programming language to give credit | Many times developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms, and more that are written by others Need to give credit | The program documentation should include the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used | May resemble a bibliography or works cited page Program documentation | . | Describes the overall program | List program specifications | Where does documentation happen Happens throughout the development of the program At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process | . | . | . 1.4 . Errors in an algorithm program . 4.1 . How do computing devices work together in a network? . Computers were once big. They grew smaller and smaller as time evolved. | Computers (their users) wanted to talk Computers are capable of sending and receiving data A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network. Each packet also includes the source and the destination information | . | . | So how do we get computer to connect and communicate? A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data | A computer system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a joint purpose | . | A bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time on a computer network | . 4.2 . . 2.1 . Binary Numbers . Binary is a number system that uses two digits 1 is on | 0 is off | . | Binary digit (bit) is the smallest unit of data in computing | Byte is a group of 8 bits | Analog: a mechanism, device, or technology that represents data by measurement of a continuous physical variable | The use of digital data to approximate real world analog data is an example of abstraction Final MC . Even though I didn’t make too many mistakes on the test, I had a few uncertain questions that I would like to delve deeper into. The first topic that I wasn’t too clear about is the internet. . | . 3.17 . Algorithmic Efficiency . an estimation of the amount of computational resources used by an algorithm; this can be determined through formal or mathematical reasoning; an informal estimation can be completed by determining the number of times a statement or group of statement executes | | . From this question, I concluded that I really just needed to memorize that information, even though it is not particularly useful for the CSP class. . The next topic that I needed to focus on is binary. Previous to the final exam, I only had a brief idea of what binary is and mainly guessed the answers for the test. After the test, I located the binary video from collegeboard, and took notes on it, now I am a lot clear on binary questions. . Before solving this problem, I mainly just guessed, but after watching the collegeboard videos I now understand how to do this question. Binary 0011 is equivalent to 2^1+2^0, or decimal 3. Binary 0110 is equivalent to 2^2+2^1, or decimal 6. Binary 1111 is equivalent to 2^3+2^2+2^1+2^0, or decimal 15. Decimal 9 is not equivalent to any of the given binary numbers. . Another type of problem that I struggled with is value swapping. The important thing about value swapping is setting a temporary variable for what you want to swap. For example, if you want to swap num1 and num2, you would assign a temp value to num1 first, then assign the value of num2 to num1, and then lastly assign the original value of num1, which is stored in temp, to num2. The original values of num1 to num2 are now interchanged . Something else that I had issues with is the vocabulary. I had difficulty distinguishing between &quot;all other&quot;, &quot;subsequent&quot;, &quot;immediately follows&quot;, and &quot;immediately precedes&quot;. I guessed that the choice is &quot;subsequent&quot; because immediately follows and immediately precedes is similar in definition, and the answer is definitely not all other, so I chose the last option left.Later on, I went back to the problem to find an explanation why the correct choice is &quot;subsequent&quot;, and that is because the outer loop iterates from the first element in the list to the second-to-last element in the list. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop compares that element to every subsequent element in the array. .",
