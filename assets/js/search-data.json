Microsoft Flight Simulator is a series of amateur flight simulator programs for Microsoft Windows operating systems. The simulator is used for training pilots and for entertainment purposes. It allows users to fly various types of aircraft in different environments and weather conditions. The simulator includes a realistic flight model and detailed 3D graphics to provide an immersive experience. Microsoft Flight Simulator is groundbreaking because it is one of the longest-running and most successful flight simulator programs. I learned about this because my friend who aspires to become a commercial jet pilot flies on microsoft flight simulator during his free time, and he gave me a tour of his flight setup which was a pretty good replica of a pilot&#39;s cockpit. .",

            "content": "Hacks . Two other popular Python libraries that are commonly used by programmers are Pandas and Matplotlib. . Pandas is a library for working with data in Python. It provides tools for reading and writing data to various formats, as well as tools for manipulating and analyzing data. For example, Pandas includes functions for filtering and sorting data, as well as tools for performing operations like groupby and pivot tables. This makes Pandas a useful tool for working with large datasets, especially those that are tabular or structured in some way. . Matplotlib is a library for creating visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of plotting functions and tools, including functions for creating scatter plots, line plots, histograms, and more. Matplotlib also includes support for customization and formatting of plots, allowing programmers to create high-quality visualizations that are tailored to their specific needs. This makes Matplotlib a valuable tool for exploring and understanding data, as well as for presenting results and findings to others. . Together, these two libraries provide a powerful set of tools for working with data in Python. Pandas makes it easy to import, manipulate, and analyze data, while Matplotlib provides a variety of tools for creating visualizations that can help to better understand and communicate the insights that can be gleaned from the data. These libraries are commonly used in a wide range of fields, including data science, scientific computing, and machine learning, and can save programmers a significant amount of time and effort when working with data in Python. .

Found at position: 10 . In the code above, the binary_search() function takes two arguments: arr, the array to search, and x, the target element we are looking for. The function returns the index of x in the array if it is found, or -1 if it is not found. The code also includes a test that searches for the value 11 in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The test prints the index of 11 if it is found, or a message if it is not found. .

In the code above, the while loop continues until n becomes 1. The if statement checks if n is even or odd, and performs the appropriate calculation to update n according to the Collatz conjecture. The steps counter is incremented after each calculation. When the loop ends, the final value of steps is printed, which represents the number of steps required to reach 1. . For the input n = 5, the code would output 6, because it takes 6 steps to reach 1 using the Collatz conjecture starting from n = 5. .",

Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators: A variable is a named location in a computer&#39;s memory where a value can be stored and retrieved. In most programming languages, variables have a specific data type, which determines the kind of values that the variable can store. . Data types are categories that are used to classify the different types of data that can be stored in a variable. Examples of common data types include integers, which are whole numbers, and strings, which are sequences of characters. . Assignment operators are operators that are used to assign a value to a variable. In most programming languages, the assignment operator is the equal sign (=). For example, the following code uses the assignment operator to assign the value 10 to a variable named x: . x = 10 . Once this code is executed, the value 10 will be stored in the variable x, and we can use the variable to access this value later in the program. For example, we could print the value of x using the following code: . print(x) # Output: 10 . It is important to note that the assignment operator is different from the equality operator (==), which is used to compare two values for equality. For example, the following code uses the equality operator to check whether the value of x is equal to 10: . if x == 10: print(&quot;x is equal to 10&quot;) . In this case, the code will print the message &quot;x is equal to 10&quot; because the value of x is indeed equal to 10. . Managing Complexity with Variables: Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class: Managing complexity with variables involves using different data structures to organize and manipulate data in a way that makes it easier to understand and work with. Some common data structures for managing complexity include lists, 2D lists, dictionaries, and classes. . A list is an ordered collection of values that can be of any data type. In most programming languages, lists are enclosed in square brackets ([]) and the values within a list are separated by commas. For example, the following code defines a list of three strings: . names = [&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;] . A 2D list, also known as a two-dimensional array or matrix, is a list of lists. It is a data structure that allows us to store and manipulate data in a grid-like format. For example, the following code defines a 2D list with three rows and four columns: . grid = [ [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12] ] . A dictionary is a data structure that maps keys to values. In most programming languages, dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces ({}) and the keys and values within a dictionary are separated by colons. For example, the following code defines a dictionary that maps strings to integers: . ages = { &quot;Alice&quot;: 25, &quot;Bob&quot;: 30, &quot;Charlie&quot;: 35 } . A class is a blueprint for creating objects. In object-oriented programming, a class defines the attributes and behaviors of a particular type of object. For example, the following code defines a class named Person with two attributes (name and age) and one behavior (a method named greet() that prints a greeting message): . A class is a blueprint for creating objects. In object-oriented programming, a class defines the attributes and behaviors of a particular type of object. For example, the following code defines a class named Person with two attributes (name and age) and one behavior (a method named greet() that prints a greeting message): . These data structures can be used to manage the complexity of data by organizing it in a way that makes it easier to understand and work with. For example, we could use a list to store a collection of strings, a 2D list to store a grid of numbers, a dictionary to store a mapping of keys to values, or a class to define the attributes and behaviors of a particular type of object. .",

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or functions, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedocode to python | . def convertFahrenheit(temperature): celsius = temperature - 32 celsius = celsius * 5/9 return celsius outsideTemp = input(&quot;What is the temperature outside?&quot;) outsideTemp = (convertFahrenheit(int(outsideTemp))) print(outsideTemp) . 15.555555555555555 . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . def gradeCalculation (score): print(&quot;What was the quiz grade?&quot;) quizGrade = input() quizGrade = int(quizGrade) currentGrade = score / 40 currentGrade = currentGrade * 100 if currentGrade &gt; quizGrade: quizGrade = currentGrade print(quizGrade) else: print(currentGrade) print(&quot;What was the overall grade&quot;) finalScore = input() finalScore = (gradeCalculation(int(finalScore))) print(finalScore) . What was the overall grade What was the quiz grade? 75.0 None . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is __ abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing __ in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called __ | A procedural abstraction may __ shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a __ procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the __ can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | . MOVE_FORWARD()|turnCorner()| ROTATE_RIGHT |MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD()|MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() MOVE_FORWARD MOVE_FORWARD() .

Drafting a Plan for the Final Project (Group Ideas) . One idea for the project would be a an app that consists of multiple games (maybe 3 to 4, something similiar to game pigeon). The games would take user input and it would also need algorithms to shoot basketballs, arrows, etc. This app would teach our team many different skills in programming. In addition, it will take our interest for 8 weeks due to the vast tasks that need to be completed. Our Team Roles: . Frontend Developer: create the visual images of games on the screen | Backend Developer: create algortihims behind the scenes | Dev Ops: make sure website functions correctly | Scrum Master: faciliate the team and assign each member differnet goals, while also helping the frontend and backend developers Because apps like game pigeon already exist, this project may or may not be able to used outside of class. Finally, the project is good for the Create Performance Task because it incorporates all the different College Board requirments | .",

            "content": "CS Before CSP . Hi my name is Max. This is my page to document my journey through CSP. My computer science journey truly started in 8th grade. There were many electives to choose going into the 8th grade, I ended up choosing computer science because that was the class that all of my friends were planning on taking. Having no previous experience in computer science, I naturally struggled throughout the year. But with pain often comes joy. I remember creating my first website using html, spending hours trying to improve every little detail to make my website more appealing. Submitting the website was one of the happiest moments of my life. That feeling of accomplishment is what motivated me to enroll in this class. Having never touched a line of code in three years, it is not surprising to say that I am really rusty. . Iterations . The first thing I learned in Mr. Mortensen&#39;s CSP class is iterations or loops. Iteration is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated. With iteration, I made a cool little quiz. . def q_and_a(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg questions = 6 correct = 0 print(&quot;Hello, you will be taking the vocabulary test.&quot;) print(&quot;Do you wish to proceed?(y/n)&quot;) msg = input() while (msg!=&quot;y&quot;) : print(&quot;ERROR, YOU HAVE TO SAY YES, DON&#39;T HAVE A CHOICE&quot;) msg = input() print(&quot;You may now proceed&quot;) rsp = q_and_a(&quot;Does static text change?

Hello, you will be taking the vocabulary test. Do you wish to proceed?(y/n) You may now proceed Question: Does static text change? (yes/no) n is wrong :( Question: At least how many lines are required to form a sequence of code?(1-4) 2 is correct! Question: Is Input and Output in jupyter notebooks in line with Output?(yes/no) no is correct!! Question: Is the computer mice an input?(yes/no) yes is correct!!

The first question of the quiz makes you believe it is a normal quiz, until you click on the next slide… . Something Different: I utilized the playSound UI control. There will be a “correct” sound when the user gets the answer correct, and a “incorrect” sound when the user gets the answer incorrect. I also utilized the setTimeout control. When I made my first test quiz I found clicking on a “next question” button was annoying, so I found out I could use the setTimeout control to automatically switch to the next page after a set amount of time. . Creation 2: . . Link To Impossible Pong . I have always been fascinated by game developing since I was a kid, and just creating this simple game showed me how tough game developing is. The main challenge of making this game was creating the motion of the opposing paddle. I realized that if I made the pong slow enough, and if I made a uniform motion of the paddle, it is actually impossible for the user to defeat the opponent, so I named my game “Impossible Pong”. Another challenge I faced while creating this game was the fact that everything when out of the borders. After some research, I found the sprites toolbox, which helps all with simple game development. “topEdge” and “bottomEdge” helped me create a border so nothing goes outside of the screen. . Something that I will work on next week is making a pong game with a smart ai, and implementing different difficulties ranging from easy to hard. .",

Perform similar operation on every element of the list . If you want to perform a set of operations on every element of a list you can do that using the map() function in Python. . mylist = [1,2,3,4,5] def multi(x): return 10*x list(map(multi, mylist)) . [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] . Merging Two Lists To Form A List . Suppose you have two lists and you want to merge the two lists to form a dictionary i.e. the elements from one list will be the keys and the elements from the other lists will be the values. Using the zip() function in python we can do that task with one line of code. . items = [&quot;footballs&quot;, &quot;bats&quot;, &quot;gloves&quot;] price = [100, 40, 80] dictionary = dict(zip(items, price)) print(dictionary) . {&#39;footballs&#39;: 100, &#39;bats&#39;: 40, &#39;gloves&#39;: 80} .

          "content": "Notes . 1.1 . Collboration . Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it | A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function | A computing innovation can be physical (eg. self-driving car), nonphysical computing software (eg. picture editing software), or a nonphysical computing concept (eg. e-commerce) | Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in development | . How to collaborate in class? . Two programmers work together as a pair. One (the driver) writes program code, while the other (the observer, pointer, or navigator) reviews each line of program code as it is typed in | Don’t be a back-seated programmer! | Think-Pair-Share: Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class | Leave comments in code Communicate to your partner(s) | Communicate to yourself | Acknowledge code segments used from other sources | Acknowledge media used form other sources | Differentiate what you and your partner(s) did | Clarify the functionality of yoru code | . | Online tools: repl.it - multiplayer | Github - collaboration and repository | Share document or folder | Ask friends and family to test your program and give you feedback | Check with your teacher | . | . 1.2 .

Inputs and Outputs . Input can come from a user or other programs Tactile (touch) | Audio | Visual | Text (including numerical values) | . | How do programs receive input? Most programs are written in an event driven environment Events are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program | . | . | What does input accomplish in a program? Input usually affects the output | . | What are outputs produced by a device? Visual | Audio | Tactile (touch/feel) | Text | . | How does a program know what to do upon an event? An action triggers an event Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device | . | . | The program code is not necessarily executed “in order” Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered | . | . What is a program . A program is a collection of statements A statement is a single command | A group of statements is called a code segment | Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language | . | . 1.3 . How is a program developed? . It starts with an idea Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan | Sometimes the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad) | . | Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect Investigation is an important step in the process | Developers must: Determine the requirements of the program | Understand the constraints | . | How do developers investigate? Surveys | User testing | Interviews | Direct observations | . | . | Design the program | Testing, testing, and more testing! | . How is a program developed . Program development is rarely a solo endeavor Programs are usually developed by teams of people | Individuals/teams work on different functional components | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work | Their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project | . | Can use comments within the programming language to give credit | Many times developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms, and more that are written by others Need to give credit | The program documentation should include the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used | May resemble a bibliography or works cited page Program documentation | . | Describes the overall program | List program specifications | Where does documentation happen Happens throughout the development of the program At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process | . | . | . 1.4 . Errors in an algorithm program . 4.1 . How do computing devices work together in a network? . Computers were once big. They grew smaller and smaller as time evolved. | Computers (their users) wanted to talk Computers are capable of sending and receiving data A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network. Each packet also includes the source and the destination information | . | . | So how do we get computer to connect and communicate? A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data | A computer system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a joint purpose | . | A bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time on a computer network | . 4.2 . . 2.1 . Binary Numbers . Binary is a number system that uses two digits 1 is on | 0 is off | . | Binary digit (bit) is the smallest unit of data in computing | Byte is a group of 8 bits | Analog: a mechanism, device, or technology that represents data by measurement of a continuous physical variable | The use of digital data to approximate real world analog data is an example of abstraction Final MC . Even though I didn’t make too many mistakes on the test, I had a few uncertain questions that I would like to delve deeper into. The first topic that I wasn’t too clear about is the internet. . | . 3.17 . Algorithmic Efficiency . an estimation of the amount of computational resources used by an algorithm; this can be determined through formal or mathematical reasoning; an informal estimation can be completed by determining the number of times a statement or group of statement executes | | . From this question, I concluded that I really just needed to memorize that information, even though it is not particularly useful for the CSP class. . The next topic that I needed to focus on is binary. Previous to the final exam, I only had a brief idea of what binary is and mainly guessed the answers for the test. After the test, I located the binary video from collegeboard, and took notes on it, now I am a lot clear on binary questions. . Before solving this problem, I mainly just guessed, but after watching the collegeboard videos I now understand how to do this question. Binary 0011 is equivalent to 2^1+2^0, or decimal 3. Binary 0110 is equivalent to 2^2+2^1, or decimal 6. Binary 1111 is equivalent to 2^3+2^2+2^1+2^0, or decimal 15. Decimal 9 is not equivalent to any of the given binary numbers. . Another type of problem that I struggled with is value swapping. The important thing about value swapping is setting a temporary variable for what you want to swap. For example, if you want to swap num1 and num2, you would assign a temp value to num1 first, then assign the value of num2 to num1, and then lastly assign the original value of num1, which is stored in temp, to num2. The original values of num1 to num2 are now interchanged . Something else that I had issues with is the vocabulary. I had difficulty distinguishing between &quot;all other&quot;, &quot;subsequent&quot;, &quot;immediately follows&quot;, and &quot;immediately precedes&quot;. I guessed that the choice is &quot;subsequent&quot; because immediately follows and immediately precedes is similar in definition, and the answer is definitely not all other, so I chose the last option left.Later on, I went back to the problem to find an explanation why the correct choice is &quot;subsequent&quot;, and that is because the outer loop iterates from the first element in the list to the second-to-last element in the list. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop compares that element to every subsequent element in the array. .",
