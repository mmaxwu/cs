# Booleans and conditionals notes

## <mark>Boolean expressions</mark>
- What is a boolean?
  - Data type with only true or false
- Boolean is related to binary
  - They both use 1 and 0

### <mark>Relational Operators</mark>
- For example, comparing the values of print statements

### <mark>Logical Operators</mark>
- AND : returns TRUE if the operands around it are TRUE
- OR : returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE
- NOT : returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE

## <mark>Conditionals</mark>
- If and else are conditionals
  - For example:


      x = 20
      y = 10
      if x > y:
          print("x is greater than y")
      else:
          print("x is not greater than y")
