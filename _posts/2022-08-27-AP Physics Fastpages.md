- Dimensions to know
  - 10^-9 nano
  - 10^-6 micro
  - 10^-3 milli
  - 10^-3 centi
  - 10^-1 deci
  - 10^1 deca
  - 10^3 kilo
  - 10^6 mega
  - 10^9 giga

- Sig figs
  - All numbers between SF are significant
  - All non-zero digits are significant
  - Leading zeroes are never significant
  - All trailing zeroes with decimal points are significant
  - Multiplication/Division: same number of SF as term with least amount of SF
  - Addition/Subtraction: same number of digits to right of DECIMAl as measurement with smallest number of digits to the right of the decimal
