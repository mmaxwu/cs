Question category: Challenge in analyzing data from many countries
I got this question wrong because I thought computer programs can't accept and process multiple data files as inputs. The right answer is B because it will be a challenge to clean the data from the different counties to make the data uniform. The way pollution data is captured and organized may vary significantly from county to county.

Question category: Effect of appending three zeros to a binary number
I got this question wrong because I multiplied the exponents wrong. It should be 2^3, not 10^3.
