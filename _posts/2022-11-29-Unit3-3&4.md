# Mathematical expressions and string notes

## <mark>Algorithm</mark>
- Sequencing
  - Algorithms do tasks in the order of specification
- Selection
  - Helps choose two different outcomes based off a decision
- Iteration
  - If a condition is true, then the code can repeat
  - Ex: For loops and while loops are both iterations

## <mark>Arithmetic Operations</mark>
- Basic Operations
  - Addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/), modulus (%)
- Operations can be done on variables
- Order of Operations
  - performed in the same order as operations in math
- Every time the value assigned to a variable is changed, it overrides the last value which was assigned to the same variable
  - This is why it is important to keep track of the value of variables

## <mark>Strings</mark>
- What is a string?
  - a collection of characters (anything from numbers, letters, spaces, special symbols, etc.)
  - Different string procedures (python)
    - len() finds the length of the string
    - lower() convert to lowercase
  - Different string procedures (pseudocode)
    - len() finds the length of the string
    - concat() returns a string made of the concatenated strings 
      - ex. concat("string1", "string2") would return string1string2
    - substring() returns the characters from the string beginning at the first position to the last 
      - ex. substring ("abcdefghijk", 2, 5) would print bcde (psuedo code starts at 1)
