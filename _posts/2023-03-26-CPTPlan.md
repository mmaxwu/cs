As of now, my CPT is done, but there are still many things that I need to do to make it ready for college board submission

- <mark>Getting rid of extra and unnecessary comments </mark>
  - Because me and my teammates were using a template for the database, there were still many comments on the code, that is unnecessary to our own code because we are using that database code for completely different purposes. 
- <mark> Changing some parts of the checkers game</mark>
  - The games that me and my groups used were games that can easily be found online, so I need to rewrite my code so to make sure the proctors at college board doesn't accuse my group of plagiarising the code
- <mark> Revising the written portion of the CPT </mark>
  - I didn't spend too much time on the first draft of my CPT written portion, so I need to go back and revise a lot of the stuff and add more details
