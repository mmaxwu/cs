## Hard Questions

For this question I didn't know what parallel processors mean/did, but now I know. This question asks for the minimum amount of time it will take to execute all three processors, so you run the 60 and run the 50 (or 60 and 30); the 50 finishes first so then you run the 30; the 60 one finishes after the 30 starts, so you add 50 and 30 because that's how long the sequence of processors will take.

For this question, I thought packets are sent in order, so I automatically got rid of A and opted with B, which seemed like the other plausible choice.

I didn't know what a programming statement is so I chose the other plausible option that I thought it was.

This question was tricky because when I read it at first, I thought the tracking collar was only applied to one animal, not a bunch of animals, therefore I picked B. However, the fact that it is a bunch of animals, and

I need to review what undecidable problems are and what heuristics are

I need to review what procedural abstraction is and what are the benefits of it

I need to review what binary search is and what the other searches are

I wasn't sure how to do this problem but ended up guessing it right

## Reflection
I realized the majority of this test's questions are about the internet. 
Here are the list of topics that I need to learn:
- Programming statement
- Undecidable problems
  - Heuristics
- Procedural abstraction
