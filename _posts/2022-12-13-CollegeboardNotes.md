## 3.17 Daily Video 1
- An algorithm's efficiency can be informally measured by determining the number of times a statement or group of statements executes
- Different correct algorithms for the same problem can have different efficiencies

## How to implement this in collegeboard?
- Give a brief example using sorting algorithms
  - Bubble sort and Insertion sort
  - Bubble Sort: For each item in list: swap with adjacent item if they are not in order. Repeat until no more swaps are necessary
  - Insertion Sort: Divides a list into two sublists: sorted and unsorted. Takes the smallest element from the unsorted list and inserts it into the correct position of the sorted list


## 3.17 Daily Video 2
- A heuristic is an approach to a problem that is not guaranteed to be optimal every time but can be used since finding the optimal solution would take an unreasonable amount of time
- A problem is a general description of a task that can (or cannot) be solved algorithmically
- An instance of a problem also includes specific input
  - ex. sorting algorithm 
- A decision problem is a problem with a yes/no answer
- An optimization problem is a problem with the goal of finding the "best" solution among many

## How to implement this information into the lesson?
- Time complexity covers this topic well 
- Talk about the different time complexities such as linear, quadratic, and constant
- Jishnu will cover the rest
