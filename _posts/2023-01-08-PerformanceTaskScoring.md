## Reflection:
For Submission 1, Collegeboard did not award the point for Program Purpose and Function because the stated purpose was not considered valid. However, I did award a point, believing that the stated purpose was sufficient. This means that when I submit my project to Collegeboard, I should provide a more detailed and specific purpose for the program, while still keeping it concise. For Submission 2, I did not award a point for Data Abstraction because I thought that a screenshot of the list variable was required in the code segment. However, Collegeboard did award the point for Data Abstraction because the code segments demonstrated the use of lists. While the list was not explicitly mentioned in the code segment, it was still evident that it was being utilized. The names of the lists were also specified in 3.b.iii, so the grader knew which variables were lists in the code. This tells me that it is important to demonstrate the use of lists in the code segments rather than just showing their creation. Through grading these submissions, I have learned that I do not need to write a whole paragraph for each subsection of 3a. I have also learned that it is important to be more detailed and explain the code when creating my project.


## Submission 1:

|Reporting Category|Student Grading Score|Collegeboard's Score|Comments|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Program Purpose and Function|1|0|The video was demonstrated clearly and the explanation followed the criteria, but Collegeboard did not award a point.|
|Data Abstraction|1|1|The data stored in the list was shown and the second code segment demonstrated its use. The name of the list variable was provided and the data it represented was described.|
|Managing Complexity|0|0|No program code was shown in this category.|
|Procedural Abstraction|1|1|The procedure and its application was shown and its contribution to the program's functionality was fully described.|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1|The code segment demonstrated sequencing, selection, and iteration using a for loop. It was very detailed and could likely be recreated.|
|Testing|1|1|The written response clearly answered all of the criteria.|



## Submission 2:

|Reporting Category|Student Grading Score|Collegeboard's Score|Comments|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Program Purpose and Function|1|1|The video demonstrated input, program functionality, and output. The written response clearly described the overall purpose, the program's functionality as shown in the video, and the input and output shown in the video.|
|Data Abstraction|0|1|The first code segment did not show a list, only a function.|
|Managing Complexity|1|1|The written response explained how the list manages complexity and the code segment demonstrated this.|
|Procedural Abstraction|1|1|Both code segments showed the procedure and its call. The description of the procedure was also very detailed and showed how it contributed to the overall functionality.|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1|Sequencing, selection, and iteration were all present in the program code segment. The steps of the algorithm were explained in great detail.|
|Testing|1|1|Two calls to the procedure were described in detail in 3c, including the conditions and results of each call.|
