### Hacks


**Question**: How do you think we should find the difference of two binary numbers? The product? The quotient? What rules need to be followed for those operations? Look into all of this on the Internet and note down important information you find (0.45) 

**To find the difference of two binary numbers, we need to subtract the subtrahend (the number being subtracted) from the minuend (the number being subtracted from). To do this, we can find the 2's complement of the subtrahend and add it to the minuend. If there is a carry after the addition, we need to discard it to get the correct answer.**



Based on what you find online, fill out the tables below for subtracting, multiplying, and dividing binary numbers (0.45):


**Subtracting Binary Numbers Rules**

|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **1-1** | **1-0** | **0-1** | **0-0** |
|    0     |     1    |     1    |     0    |


**Multiplying Binary Numbers Rules**


|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **1x1** | **1x0** | **0x1** | **0x0** |
|    1     |     0    |    0     |    0     |


**Dividing Binary Numbers Rules**

|---------|---------|
| **1/1** | **0/1** |
|     1    |    0    |        


Choose ONE (0.9 for doing one):

- Create buttons similar to the ones above that allow you to subtract binary numbers and returns the desired result in both binary and decimal

In the above button, I was able to create a button that subtracts binary numbers and returns that desired result in both binary and decimal.

## Logic Gates
1. How can logic gates be used to execute basic computer functions?
Logic gates are the basic building blocks of digital circuits, and they can be used to execute basic computer functions. Different combinations of logic gates can be used to create more complex circuits that can perform a wide range of functions.

2. What is the difference between boolean operations and logic gates?
Boolean operations are mathematical operations on Boolean values that produce a Boolean result, while logic gates are physical or electronic devices that implement Boolean functions and are used to perform logical operations on binary inputs.
